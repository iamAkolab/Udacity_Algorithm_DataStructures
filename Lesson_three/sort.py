 Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements.
 
 Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
 compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. ... 
 The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list
